# Image Tagger

The package contains methods to tag images based on the output of the pretrained YOLOv5s model and sklearn's facial recognition model. The added tags are included during indexing in both Windows and iOS, which means the images can be found by searching their tags. 

## Dependencies

- [pyexiv2](https://pypi.org/project/pyexiv2/)
- [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
- [facenet_pytorch](https://pypi.org/project/facenet-pytorch/)
- [YOLOv5 dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/yolov5/master/requirements.txt)

## How to Run

```
import tagger
tagger.initialize('path/to/image_folder', 'path/to/labeled_face_image_folder')
tagger.tag()
```

## Sources

#### Images

- Images in `face_sample` are extracted from the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people.html) dataset.
- Images in `images_before`:
    - Images named `imageX.jpg` are downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) for demonstration purposes.

- Images in `images_after` are tagged by this application 


#### Code

- `face_recognition.py` is written based on `Face_Recognition.ipynb`

- Code in `face_recognition_dataset.py` is copied from `Face_Recognition.ipynb`

## Output

- Some samples are included in `Backend/images_before` and `Backend/images_after`

- After running `tagall.py`\
