- re model performance: I would not worry too much about this. If I recall correctly, YoloV5 is used in your project, and one of the weaknesses of the model is not able to detect smaller objects (a tradeoff in order to improve throughput). Also, in the "machine learning world", it is actually a cardinal sin to remove samples that do not perform well in the training set, since this adds bias to the training process, and may lead to overfitting. Ideally, you would want to compare  the notebook model and what is being deployed, and determine the root cause of the performance difference (I assume the notebook model is what would be used to deploy? So the performance difference shouldn't be too drastic and if it is, then maybe something is going wrong in the deployment process).
- re public access: Unless most of the milestone goals are reached, I would not sweat this part too much if the backend works locally, especially if there are more pressing issues regarding the ML portion of the project.
